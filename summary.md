Training Dataset gave higher returns than benchmark returns.
However, Testing Dataset gave lower returns than training dataset.

In Training Dataset, RSI strategy gave higher returns than SMA+Bollinger Bands
In Testing Dataset, the combination of SMA and Bollinger Bands gave higher returns than RSI.

This is caused due to underfitting of data.
This is due to changes in recent market trends compared to historical market trends.


P.S. A better alternative to SMA is Exponential Moving Average which gives more weights to recent market trends.
